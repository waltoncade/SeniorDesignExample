### Not holding coffee giveaway this semester

### How to enter your name/email into coffee giveaway
1. Create github account and download GitHub desktop!
2. Fork repository waltoncade/SeniorDesignExample (you should now see a repository under your account named "SeniorDesignExample")
3. Clone YOUR forked repository to your desktop using GitHub Desktop (the repository you clone should be under YOUR account, not waltoncade) (NOTE: GitHub Desktop will know this is a forked repsitory, you should select the option to "contribute to original repository")
4. Open the CoffeeGiveaway.txt file where you cloned your repository and add your name and email to it
5. Commit your changes and push them (you should now see your changes reflected in your forked repository in GitHub)
6. Go to my waltoncade/SeniorDesignExample repository and click on "Pull Requests" -> "New Pull Request" -> "Compare Across Forks" (little blue link)
7. Select your forked repository/branch as the "HEAD REPOSITORY" and the base repository as the waltoncade one!

8. Click "Create Pull request", fill in necessary info and confirm!


NOTE: Some of you will try to contribute to the same line (since you might be working on this in parallel). This might make it so have to deal with some conflicts which is a good learning experience. If you do, you have to do the following:
1. Return to GitHub desktop, select the tab "Branch" and select the option "Update from origin" (something similar to this)
2. Resolve any merge conflicts and re-commit and push
3. Restart from step 6 above!

This is my first time trying this. I am sure you will encounter issues that I am not aware of. If you do, please send me an email and I will try to help (please try google first!), although my response may be delayed!
